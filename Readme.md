> This tool provides the structural foundation for various software extensions
> to seamlessly coexist within a single visual space. Users can program
> autonomous components that not only display information on a character matrix
> but also act as orchestrators for other subcomponents. This visual hierarchy
> grants developers absolute control over the interface layout and interaction
> distribution, ensuring that every element operates in a fluid and coordinated
> manner.
